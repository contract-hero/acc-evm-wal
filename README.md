# acc-evm-wal

A **content plugin** for the [Agentic Community College (ACC)](https://github.com/alilloig/agentic-community-college) framework. This repo ships a short course on Walrus decentralized storage basics and how to integrate it into a Solidity smart contract; the ACC plugin owns the runtime that actually drives the lessons.

## How it plugs in

`.claude-plugin/plugin.json` declares:

```json
{
  "name": "acc-evm-wal",
  "accContent": {
    "lessons": "./lessons/",
    "probes": [ /* prerequisite checks for the lessons here */ ]
  }
}
```

When this plugin is enabled alongside `agentic-community-college`, ACC scans `~/.claude/plugins/installed_plugins.json` at startup, finds this manifest's `accContent` block, and aggregates every lesson under `lessons/<slug>/` into its catalog. Probes declared here resolve at runtime when a lesson lists them in its `prerequisites`.

## What's inside

```
acc-evm-wal/
├── .claude-plugin/plugin.json    name + accContent (lessons + probes), no executable bits
├── README.md                     this file
├── CLAUDE.md                     working notes for Claude when authoring lessons here
└── lessons/                      one directory per lesson, each a hard copy of a reference app
                                  plus its ordered section sequence, tests, and HTML artifact
```

## Authoring a new lesson

Don't write lesson files by hand. From inside any ACC-enabled session, invoke the `lesson-creator` skill. Point it at this repo and a reference codebase, and it scaffolds the whole lesson directory.

## Running a lesson

1. Install (or enable) both this plugin **and** `agentic-community-college` in Claude Code.
2. Run `/agentic-community-college:start` from any project directory.
3. Pick a lesson by namespaced slug (e.g. `acc-evm-wal@<marketplace>/01-some-lesson`).
4. ACC drives you through it — runs any prerequisite probes declared in this plugin, asks for learning vs explanatory mode, sets personalization, walks the section sequence.
